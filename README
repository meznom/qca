ExactDiagonalisation
====================

Installation
------------

Requirements:
 * cmake[1], version 2.6 or greater.
 * Eigen[2], version 2.92.0 (Eigen 3.0-beta2) or greater.
 * Boost[3] to build the unit tests. I'm using version 1.42, but older versions
   will probably work as well.
 * Doxygen[4] to generate the documentation.

Build:
 $ mkdir build_dir
 $ cd build_dir
 $ ccmake source_dir
 $ make
To build and run the unit tests:
 $ make check
To generate the documentation:
 $ make doc

Note: CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE and EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR need to be set with cmake. Build
type can be either Release or Debug. The latter builds with debugging
information (surprise), assertions and is much, much slower.

Note: On Mac OS X a ncurses related bug makes ccmake unusable. Use 
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=... -DEIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR=... source_dir
instead.


Running
-------

After compilation a file runQca should be in the build_dir. Run
 $ ./runQca --help
to get startet.
