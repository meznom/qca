ExactDiagonalisation
====================

Installation
------------

Requirements:
 * cmake[1], version 2.6 or greater.
 * Eigen[2], version 2.92.0 (Eigen 3.0-beta2) or greater.
 * Boost[3] to build the unit tests. I'm using version 1.42, but older versions
   will probably work as well.
 * Doxygen[4] to generate the documentation.

Build:
 $ mkdir build_dir
 $ cd build_dir
 $ ccmake source_dir
 $ make
To build and run the unit tests:
 $ make check
To generate the documentation:
 $ make doc

Note: CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE and EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR need to be set with cmake. Build
type can be either Release or Debug. The latter builds with debugging
information (surprise), assertions and is much, much slower.

Note: On Mac OS X a ncurses related bug makes ccmake unusable. Use 
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=... -DEIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR=... source_dir
instead.


Usage
-----

After compilation a file runQca should be in the build_dir. Run
 $ ./runQca --help
to get startet.

For example,
 $ runQca -E -m grandDP -p 1 -t 1 -td 0 -V0 1000 -a 0.01 -b 1000
calculates the energy spectrum for the one plaquet grand-canonical system (with
a dead plaquet) and the given parameters, whereas
 $ runQca -P 0,1 -m quarterDP -p 2 -t 1 -td 0 -V0 1000 \
          -beta 0.01,0.1,1,10 -a 0.01 -b 0.0175,0.025 -Pext 1
computes the polarisation of the first and second plaquet over beta, for the
two plaquet quarter-filled system (again, the dead plaquet variant) and for two
different values of b, the inter-plaquet spacing.
