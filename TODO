Optimize diagonalization
------------------------

in Hamiltonian::diagonalizeUsingSymmetries
idea: avoid dynamic memory allocations as much as possible

implement definitely:

find out the largest block
allocate dense matrix once (sized for largest block) and then reuse it (with block())
allocate SelfAdjointEigenSolver once and then reuse it

implement maybe:

sort blocks according to size: usually we have a lot of blocks of the same size
this would than avoid resizing of the matrices used in the SelfAdjointEigenSolver
however it would then be more costly to build the sparse eigenvectors matrix





maybe implement Block for sparse matrices (a Block mapping sparse to dense --
this would avoid one matrix copy operation, and I wouldn't need to allocate a
dense matrix in diagonalizeUsingSymmetries at all)

the question is whether the dynamic memory allocation really is that expensive

Even though I supposedly optimized memory usage, now the usage is still > 2.2GB. Maybe there's a memory leak somewhere. Probably best to use valgrind.
